# a277d-led-tachometer
Analog LED tachometer controlled by an East German A277D chip (clone of UAA180). The mainboard has an ATtiny13A microcontroller, generating a variable ignition pulse for testing. The pulse generator board can be broken off the mainboard if the mainboard is placed in an actual car.
